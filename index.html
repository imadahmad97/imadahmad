  <h1>Imad Ahmad</h1>
  <h2>Data Analyst</h2>
Welcome to my website!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a current Masters candidate completing my Masters of Data Science and Analytics at the University of Calgary. I completed my undergraduate degree in Physiology and Psychology at the University of British Columbia.
<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in all things data related! I have two years of experience in Python, R and SQL including relevant data science libraries. Additionally, I have a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics, as well as AWS, Apache Spark, and BigQuery.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently seeking internships for Summer 2023. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions regarding my personal projects or just wanna talk data! Check out the "project portfolio" section to see a full run down of my projects!
